## Answer the following questions:
### Which of the method (counting expressions with capital letters vs. NER) worked better for the task concerned with identification of the proper names?


### What are the drawbacks of the method based on capital letters?


### What are the drawbacks of the method based on NER?


### Which of the coarse-grained NER groups has the best and which has the worst results? Try to justify this observation.


### Do you think NER is sufficient for identifying different occurrences of the same entity (i.e. consider "USA" and "Stany Zjednoczone" and "Stany Zjednoczone Ameryki Północnej") ? If not, can you suggest an algorithm or a tool that would be able to group such names together?


### Can you think of a real world problem that would benefit the most from application of Named Entity Recognition algorithm?
